# Applying Bayesian Inference
One additional approach, that I'd like to at least explore briefly here, is to use Bayesian Inference for language model-like tasks, like next word prediction. The theory behind Bayesian Inference is that, unlike frequentist methods, we can use knowledge of our existing dataset (a prior) to inform our predictions. We'll see in this section how this task can be applied to next word prediction.
